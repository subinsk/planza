# Planza Blank Page Issue - FIXED! üéâ

## What was the problem?
The https://planza-app.vercel.app/ was showing a blank page because:

1. **Missing Auth0 Configuration**: The `index.html` had a placeholder `YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` instead of actual values
2. **No Environment Variable Injection**: The webpack configuration wasn't properly injecting environment variables during the build process
3. **Missing Custom Webpack Builder**: Angular wasn't using the custom webpack configuration

## What was fixed?

### ‚úÖ 1. Updated Angular Build Configuration
- Updated `angular.json` to use `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` 
- Installed the correct version (v13) compatible with Angular 13
- Configured both build and serve to use custom webpack

### ‚úÖ 2. Fixed Webpack Environment Injection  
- Updated `apps/planza/webpack.config.js` to properly inject environment variables
- Added support for both development and production environments
- Added debug logging to track environment variable injection

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated ConfigService
- Modified `apps/planza/src/app/core/services/config.service.ts` to read from `process.env` instead of `globalThis.__ENV__`
- Added proper fallback values and debug logging
- Improved error handling for missing configuration

### ‚úÖ 4. Cleaned up index.html
- Removed hardcoded placeholder values from `apps/planza/src/index.html`
- Environment variables are now injected at build time via webpack

## Next Steps (Required for Full Fix)

### üîß Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

You need to add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your planza-app project  
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add these variables:

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN=planza.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://planza.us.auth0.com/api/v2/  
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID]
BASE_URL=https://planza-app.vercel.app
API_URL=https://planza-api.onrender.com/api
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Important**: Replace `[YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID]` with your real Auth0 Client ID for production.

### üìã Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

```bash
vercel env add AUTH0_DOMAIN production
# Enter: planza.us.auth0.com

vercel env add AUTH0_AUDIENCE production  
# Enter: https://planza.us.auth0.com/api/v2/

vercel env add AUTH0_CLIENT_ID production
# Enter: [your actual client ID]

vercel env add BASE_URL production
# Enter: https://planza-app.vercel.app

vercel env add API_URL production
# Enter: https://planza-api.onrender.com/api

vercel env add NODE_ENV production
# Enter: production
```

### üöÄ Redeploy

After setting the environment variables:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Files Changed

- `angular.json` - Added custom webpack builder configuration
- `apps/planza/webpack.config.js` - Fixed environment variable injection  
- `apps/planza/src/app/core/services/config.service.ts` - Updated to read from process.env
- `apps/planza/src/index.html` - Removed hardcoded placeholder values
- `package.json` - Added @angular-builders/custom-webpack dependency
- `vercel.json` - Ready for environment variable injection

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Local Build**: Working perfectly  
‚úÖ **Code Changes**: Committed and pushed  
‚è≥ **Production Deploy**: Needs environment variables to be set in Vercel  

The blank page issue should be completely resolved once you set the Auth0 environment variables in your Vercel dashboard and redeploy the application.

## Testing the Fix

You can test the current build locally by running:
```bash
npm run build
cd dist/apps/planza  
http-server -p 3000
```

The webpack debug logs will show that environment variables are being properly injected during the build process.
